# Abstract

We report the methodology and results from the Capstone module of the HarvardX PH125.9 "Data Science" course available on edx.org.

A dataset named _edx_ was generated according to course instructions. It comprises approximately 9.10^3 observations, each corresponding to a user-assigned rating of a movie.
